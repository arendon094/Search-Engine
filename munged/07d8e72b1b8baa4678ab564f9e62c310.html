        Del Boy was born after the 
        <a href="a6bc5bf53e5644a415ca8129c0eb2440.html" title="World War II">War</a> and became his family's main moneymaker before he left school. His gift of the gab made him a natural salesman, no matter what the quality, safety, legality or suitability of the goods in his possession. Devoted to the memory of his mother and hateful of the way his father left after her death, Del puts family high on his agenda, refusing to put Rodney into care as a child and looking after Grandad in his frailty until his death. That said, Del was never afraid to stitch up Rodney to save his own skin or pride or for his own personal amusement or gain (he has had two free holidays from exploiting Rodney). Popular with the ladies, Del was engaged numerous times during the

Del's luck changed in 1996 when an antique watch hidden in his garage made him and his family overnight millionaires. He lived the high life for 5 years before losing it all in 2001 due to a stock market crash.

        Rodney Charlton Trotter was born in the early 1960s after being accidentally conceived and never got to know his parents. His mother died and his father absconded before he had barely started school, so he was brought up by his teenage brother Derek and his declining Grandad. Rodney was a bright but easily-influenced child, attaining GCE passes in mathematics and art before going to art college in 
        <a href="d00469325bdebf64cb0d738716cdb7cb.html" title="Basingstoke">Basingstoke</a>, where he was thrown out after three weeks for smoking 
        <a href="45cfa1ca103176b5b4368db062c735de.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a>, which also earned him a criminal conviction, a fine and a suspended prison sentence. Rodney subsequently became Del's apprentice, suitcase-carrier and general whipping boy, and became the opposite to his brother cerebrally - blessed with knowledge but lacking entirely in street-wisdom or common sense, hence Del's frequent labelling of him as a "plonker". Rodney tried numerous times to take more control of the business, pursue new interests or go out on his own, but it was only after meeting Cassandra at his evening school that Del finally decided not to interfere. Rodney duly married Cassandra but continued to stay to an extent under Del's influence. In the final episode of the show, 
        <a href="1c2bebbfb0f9fd777e427d838b08ccb6.html" title="Sleepless in Peckham">Sleepless in Peckham</a>, it was finally revealed to Rodney that his biological father was in fact local gentleman crook "Freddie the Frog", and not Reg Trotter, following much speculation in preceding episodes. In the same episode he and Cassandra became the parents of a baby girl, named Joan after his mother.

        Born at the turn of the 20th century, Edward "Grandad" Trotter, grandfather on Del's father's side (Del and Rodney's absent father Reginald was his son) served in the Army during the Second World War and worked in a number of semi-skilled jobs. He was 
        <a href="b373fd629f57770c28a7d4b8fc353f3b.html" title="Widow">widowed</a> early and spent much of his final years almost completely housebound, although Del made him responsible for the housekeeping and the cooking while he and Rodney went out to work. Grandad was never seen without his hat (even wearing it in bed), watched at least two television sets at once and rarely failed to burn the meals he prepared. He died sometime between late 1984 and early 1985 (just as filming for Series 4 was getting underway) and was buried in the episode "

        Born approximately in the early 1920s after his elder brother Edward, Albert Gladstone Trotter was a seaman as man and boy, initially in the

        <a href="6a45fb5bfa13f3004257c4576af1b6d2.html" title="British Merchant Navy">Merchant</a>. He married Ada but the marriage didn't work out for reasons unknown, and Albert was a pensioner alone, moving to the homes of distant relation after distant relation, until attending Grandad's funeral and moving in with his great-nephews Del and Rodney afterwards in 1985. He took over the Grandad roles of housekeeping and cooking, doing a considerably better job of it, and was also in the Nag's Head with Del and Rodney frequently, drinking rum, playing the piano and singing (despite his singing having been banned by Mike). Albert never stopped talking about his war days to anyone in earshot, often issuing tedious anecdotes which allowed Del, Rodney and other characters to mock him. Albert's death - nearly 17 years after moving in with his great-nephews - was mourned on as grand a scale as Grandad's. This was written into the next episode made after the death of actor Buster Merryfield in 1999. In his will, Albert left Del and Rodney £145,000 each, which got them out of debt with the

        The chief supporting character throughout the show's run, Trigger was a local

He went to school with Del and has always swept the roads of Peckham by day before propping up the Nag's Head bar at night. Early in the run we saw Trigger also as a mild crook and trader but eventually he stopped getting involved in buying and selling and just became a valued hanger-on. Despite being extremely dim, Trigger's generosity and good nature is respected by all in the area. He consistently called Rodney "Dave" under the genuine belief that that is his name, even though he hears everyone else using the correct name time and again. John Sullivan later revealed that Trigger's real name is Colin Ball.

        A trained actress and singer whose career never took off, Rachel "Raquel" Turner married and then separated from policeman Roy Slater before joining up with a dating agency, where she was introduced to Del. They hit it off but split after a row over Raquel's part-time job as a stripper. They re-met accidentally in 
        <a href="287e2ca0af43f14c38f9ef35617bea52.html" title="Margate">Margate</a>, where Del was stranded after missing his transport back from a day trip, and Raquel was working in a club as one half of a conjurer's act. This time they got back together and Raquel moved in, taking much of the housekeeping duty off Albert while also trying occasionally to relaunch her theatrical career. She and Del survived a crisis after Del found out the identity of her ex-husband - Slater was his old nemesis - and had an unplanned but very welcome son, Damien, although they never got round to marrying. Raquel was responsible for re-furnishing and re-decorating the flat to the extent that it looked like a family home for the first time.

        An intelligent, slightly spoilt daughter of a wealthy, self-made businessman, Cassandra was a bank worker who was taking evening classes when she met Rodney, with whom she started a relationship after they danced together at a nightclub. Their love blossomed to the extent that even Del approved, and the two soon married. Cassandra's ambitious nature and Rodney's own difficulty in untying the apron strings of his family meant the marriage initially struggled to work, with the two separating after a year, although ultimately they reconciled their differences and grew stronger, especially after Cassandra miscarried their first child. She later gave birth to Joan Trotter (whom Rodney named after his and Del's mother).

Corinne could see through Del and could never understand why Denzil saw him as a true friend. In the end, the dragon wife of Denzil could not longer stand his inability to stand up to Del and left him, never to be seen again. In fact, the actress playing her had in fact killed herself. Out of respect, John Sullivan never did the same to Corinne, but instead mentioned her several times throughout the series.

        The landlord of the Nag's Head (although not from the very beginning; his predecessor was never seen, with just a succession of barmaids providing service), Mike Fisher became a respected landlord and friend of the regulars, often targeted by Del as a potential customer for any dubious gear he was selling. Mike's private affairs rarely were discussed, although he was divorced before taking over the pub. The death of actor Kenneth MacDonald in 2001 prompted a plot line of Mike's imprisonment (Request by Kenneth before he died) for fraud in subsequent episodes, with the local cafe owner Sid taking over as licensee of the pub.

When Del goes to visit him with stomach cramps, he discovers that Robbie has since left his practice and gone to the local hospital. Del tells his new GP a completely opposite story about his lifestyle, that he is a celibate, tee-toal, non-smoking, vegetarian health freak. The GP, unable to ascertain why Del is experiencing such difficulties, sends him to hospital. While Del is worrying about what is wrong with him, Robbie finally comes to see him, stating he is now in charge of Del's case, being as he is a former patient. Robbie warns Del that lying to his GP has meant that diagnosing Del's condition (
