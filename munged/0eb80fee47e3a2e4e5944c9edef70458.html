      <p>Little is known about Parsons' life before Treadstone; however, several things can be inferred. Though Julia Stiles was only 21 years old when <i><a href="6dcb1331da6be896bb440679178751b9.html" title="The Bourne Identity (2002 film)">The Bourne Identity</a></i> was released (19-20 when it was filmed), <i>Identity</i> director Doug Liman stated that the Nicky Parsons character was about 25 years old. Parsons stated in <i><a href="0b8ad8f6fdfd27b39eddb55d6497d74e.html" title="The Bourne Supremacy (film)">The Bourne Supremacy</a></i> that she had worked in Treadstone for three years before its demise, which occurred at the end of <i>Identity</i>, making Parsons 22 years old when she joined the program. Because she was a <a href="b4ad201e4565ae8cbea963a7bdaa7c6b.html" title="Psychologist">psychologist</a> as well as <a href="109ec125a3c97faaa0baa23a19cbeca8.html" title="Logistics">logistics</a> coordinator, Parsons had to have finished college. (Contradicting that is when Nicky enters Daniels office in Ultimatum and is forced to answer the phone. Landy confirms she is Treadstone and her file is pulled up at and can be seen on screen. According to her file her date of birth March 28, 1979) The CIA utilized her young age as her cover when she worked for Treadstone in Paris; she claimed to be an American student studying abroad.</p> 
      <p>Parsons had two responsibilities in Treadstone: First, and most oft-portrayed in the movies, coordinating logistical operations; second, monitoring the mental health of Treadstone agents. She also served as Bourne's contact in <a href="3dc2a83cac43237809afc2bfa8c3f07e.html" title="Paris">Paris</a> up until he was shot during the (failed) Nykwana Wombosi assassination.</p> 
      <p>As logistics coordinator, Parsons handled many technical tasks during Treadstone missions. In <i>The Bourne Identity</i>, she was responsible for many smaller tasks, such as printing <a href="878a8f7f269897440a765636d88691f0.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Wanted posters">wanted posters</a> for Bourne and his traveling partner (later girlfriend), Marie Helena Kreutz, and operating a <a href="52d05fad900703e21e76afdaf5ab74b9.html" title="Switchboard">switchboard</a> through which calls to and from Treadstone's base were filtered. She also handled more important tasks, such as being commanded to cover up the very public death of an agent, the agent killed himself by jumping out a window to escape Bourne after Bourne beat him severely (although she specifically says that she couldn't because it was public and in Paris). Essentially, her job as logistics coordinator involved managing the technical details of Treadstone missions and cleaning up collateral damage.</p> 
      <p>As mental health supervisor, Parsons dealt with the wide array of psychological disturbances suffered by Treadstone agents, not only after their traumatic conditioning (which involved fake "behavior modification" tools as near drowning, starvation, and sleep deprivation to break the will of the agents), but also in dealing with their daily lives as assassins. Symptoms she witnessed included, "depression, anger, compulsive behaviors... they had physical symptoms: headaches, sensitivity to light..." Before Bourne, however, she had never seen an agent develop <a href="8c5f8b108493de32bc782f3d166bb53f.html" title="Amnesia">amnesia</a>. Though her responsibilities as mental health supervisor were not explored in detail, Stiles stated that the Parsons character handled medication for the agents.</p> 
      <p>Within the first two years after Treadstone's demise, Parsons was transferred to <a href="9cca77a4aac5d016eb15bcdbc88d0c7f.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="cb71518547c652e16a5fc94eae73ae10.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. Her job there was never explained; however, when she was transferred to <a href="28902b9cebcfd9b162270722372c25ec.html" title="Madrid">Madrid</a>, <a href="e90aff26c9e29335e535a152cb7b6507.html" title="Spain">Spain</a> immediately after <i>Supremacy</i>, she continued to handle logistical operations. Whether or not she continued her psychiatric duties is unclear.</p>

      <p>Nicky Parsons First appeared in <i>The Bourne Identity</i>, playing a very small and undefined role. She appeared at that time to be Deputy Director Alex Conklin's assistant, described by Julia Stiles as a "glorified operator." She operated out of <a href="3babc39b6926a0e299eacaca2e616b50.html" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="80cb27695020a32bae11c128e90382c1.html" title="France">France</a>, handling a variety of technical details in the search for Jason Bourne. She was also present when Bourne confronted Conklin in Parsons's base of operation in Paris. Though she and Bourne exchanged no dialogue, she witnessed Bourne reveal that he had amnesia, recover his memory of his last (failed) mission to kill Nykwana Wombosi, and his decision to leave the CIA (including his threat to fight them if they came after him). When Bourne realized that Conklin had triggered an alarm for backup, he knocked out Conklin and killed the backup agents to escape; however, he left Nicky unharmed. After Conklin's supervisor, Deputy Director Ward Abbott, had Conklin killed, Parsons was the only living witness to the events (aside from Bourne, of course). Although Bourne's motives were never addressed, it is possible that he suspected that Conklin would be assassinated, and left Nicky unharmed to witness him leave without killing Conklin; thus, Conklin's murder could not be blamed on Bourne.</p>

      <p>Parsons' role was significantly expanded in <i>The Bourne Supremacy</i>, mostly to define her role in Treadstone. After the events of <i>The Bourne Identity</i>, Operation Treadstone was shut down, forcing all its employees to be reassigned. Two years later, when the events of <i><a href="d00469325bdebf64cb0d738716cdb7cb.html" title="The Bourne Supremacy (film)">The Bourne Supremacy</a></i> took place, Parsons was stationed in <a href="736895c8ab486fa49cf70663cfd98233.html" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="d71f420c07db6c2c4cdd8aced9cc015f.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. When Bourne was framed for the murder of two CIA agents, Parsons was called in to assist in locating Bourne. It was then revealed that Parsons was not only the coordinator of Logistics for Operation Treadstone, but also the mental health supervisor and Bourne contact in Paris. She showed a clear understanding of agents' thinking patterns, interrupting a discussion amongst higher-ranked officials to analyze aspects of Bourne's behavior that had been wrongly deemed "random" or "a mistake."</p> 
      <p>When Bourne first called Deputy Director Pamela Landy, he set up a meeting with Parsons at the <a href="8c2211fc10a900b7748427d1519b40e1.html" title="Alexanderplatz">Alexanderplatz</a> in <a href="2e0c4f10d5b5a114c0067b791de71eda.html" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, claiming that he wanted to "come in," escorted by someone he knew. Though Landy knew it was a ruse, she let Parsons go to the meeting wearing a wire in order to obtain information from Bourne. Bourne had seen an advertisement earlier for a rally at that location, so when the crowds filed in and the Agency could no longer cover Parsons, Bourne led her via cell phone into a subway station to interrogate her without visual surveillance, though he probably knew she was wearing a wire. She told him that she believed him to be innocent (though in context, she may have simply been pleading for her life). She willingly answered his questions regarding Deputy Director Pamela Landy, the end of Treadstone, and why Landy was trying to capture him (because Landy believed Bourne had killed her agents); however, she also asked him questions that led him to describe his whereabouts during the aforementioned assassinations ("4,000 miles away in <a href="aadf292ea4d21754484080239369f5ed.html" title="India">India</a> watching Marie die") with such emotionality that Landy began to believe Bourne was innocent. Eventually, Bourne led Parsons to a location where her wire failed to transmit a signal so he could interrogate her more aggressively regarding both the murders he was framed for and his first mission. Though she knew little about the murders and nothing about his first mission, he was able to attain enough information from her to jog his own memory, making the connection between the murders and his first mission and recalling the name of his first victim, Vladimir Neski. Bourne tried to learn more about the Neski mission, but when Nicky told him she knew nothing about it, he pushed her to the floor, put a gun to her head, and screamed at her in an attempt to make her talk. She pled for her life, crying and insisting that she knew nothing about the mission. Bourne eventually let her go unharmed. This was her last appearance in <i>The Bourne Supremacy</i>.</p>

      <p>In <i>The Bourne Identity</i> and <i>The Bourne Supremacy</i>, the possibility of a past relationship between Parsons and Bourne had not been addressed; however, their relationship was a key factor in <i>The Bourne Ultimatum</i>. For most of the movie, the emotion seemed one-sided; Parsons often gazed longingly at Bourne while Bourne was lost in his own thoughts. After he saved Parsons from Desh, however, Bourne finally opened up to Parsons. Bourne seemed shaken when he saw Nicky after she cut her hair and dyed it black, unknowingly giving herself the same haircut Bourne gave Marie just before their first kiss. Unlike his encounter with Marie, however, Bourne and Parsons did not engage in any sexual activity with each other at any time throughout the trilogy.</p>

      <p>In <i>The Bourne Identity</i> and <i>The Bourne Supremacy</i>, the possibility of a past relationship between Parsons and Bourne had not been addressed; however, their relationship was a key factor in <i>The Bourne Ultimatum</i>. Unfortunately, little is known about their past. The most telling moment occurred in a diner, when Bourne asked her why she was helping him. She hesitated for a long while, nervously rubbing her coffee cup with her thumb before sheepishly responding, "It was difficult for me... with you..." After another long pause, she said with tears in her eyes, "You really don't remember anything?" Based on this scene, it is quite probable that she and Bourne had some sort of romantic relationship before his amnesia. For most of the movie, the emotion seemed one-sided: Parsons often gazed longingly at Bourne while Bourne was lost in his own thoughts. After he saved Parsons from Desh, however, Bourne finally opened up to Parsons. Bourne seemed shaken when he saw Nicky after she cut her hair and dyed it black, possibly being reminded of his first kiss with Marie after she cut and dyed her hair. Unlike his encounter with Marie, however, Bourne and Parsons did not engage in any sexual activity with each other at any time throughout the trilogy. As Parsons was boarding the train to run away in <i>Ultimatum</i>, Bourne called out after her, "It gets easier." Bourne was clearly unaccustomed to reaching out to people, so his attempt to comfort Nicky in the end shows that he might have developed (or redeveloped) feelings for her, as well.</p>

      <ul> 
       <li>Because a blond woman was seen during Bourne's flashbacks to his training, some believe that she played a part in it, but that is not the case. In a <i>Bourne Supremacy</i> deleted scene, Landy stated that the Neski assassination, Bourne's first mission, occurred in 1989. Parsons didn't join the program until ten years later. She would have been twelve years old during Bourne's first mission, and probably younger during his training. Also, careful observation reveals that the blond woman is not Julia Stiles.</li>
