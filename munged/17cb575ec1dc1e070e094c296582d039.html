      <p>The <b>Grand Slam</b> in men's golf is an unofficial concept, having changed over time. In the modern era, The Grand Slam is generally considered to be winning all four of golf's <a href="9d1f6ae8fc5fd061a9fe1e930f87e4da.html" title="Men's major golf championships">major championships</a> in the same calendar year. Before <a href="7d753d54393326720faa297402b1521f.html" class="mw-redirect" title="The Masters Tournament">The Masters</a> was founded, the national amateur championships of the U.S and the UK were considered majors along with the two national opens and only <a href="d313b7e8a009e552dc69da4a2cc9f18f.html" title="Bobby Jones (golfer)">Bobby Jones</a> has ever completed a grand slam with these. No man has ever achieved a modern grand slam, Tiger Woods being the closest in winning all four consecutively, but over two calendar years.</p> 
      <p>The term also refers to a tour tournament, the <a href="ffe23a919b5a9b5e471b82a71ff139ac.html" title="PGA Grand Slam of Golf">PGA Grand Slam of Golf</a>, an annual off season tournament contested by the winners of the four major championships.</p> 
      <p>In annual playing order, the modern major championships are:</p>

      </ol> 
      <p>The term "Grand Slam" was first applied to <a href="b64c416781ae972fa97b9f6bfbbe71f5.html" title="Bobby Jones (golfer)">Bobby Jones</a>' achievement of winning the four major golf events of <a href="4576bbd28b4fc8c2e93d1100c9ab5fcb.html" title="1930 in sports">1930</a>: <a href="1357f2fb27eaa33929340321af0e2142.html" title="The Open Championship">The Open Championship</a>, the <a href="a475b296c3c8c8840e4de0f89cf61d1d.html" title="U.S. Open (golf)">U.S. Open Championship</a>, the <a href="746184bb1c278c90ed60aa751c7d8bb3.html" class="mw-redirect" title="United States Men's Amateur Golf Championship">United States Men's Amateur Golf Championship</a> and <a href="ef8e717b1dff397b979317bf0a455b2a.html" title="The Amateur Championship">The (British) Amateur Championship</a>. When Jones won all four, the sports world searched for ways to capture the magnitude of his accomplishment. Up to that time, there was no term to describe such a feat because no one had thought it possible. The Atlanta Journal's O.B. Keeler dubbed it the "Grand Slam," borrowing a <a href="b96d8591447f0e49041e6518f80fd20a.html" title="Contract bridge">bridge</a> term. George Trevor of the New York Sun wrote that Jones had "stormed the impregnable quadrilateral of golf." Keeler would later write the words that would forever be linked to one of the greatest individual accomplishments in the history of sports: This victory, the fourth major title in the same season and in the space of four months, had now and for all time entrenched Bobby Jones safely within the "Impregnable Quadrilateral of Golf", that granite fortress that he alone could take by escalade, and that others may attack in vain, forever.</p> 
      <p>Jones remains the only man to have achieved the grand slam, since before the creation of The Masters and the advent of the professional era, the amateur championships were considered major championships.</p> 
      <p>The modern definition could not be applied until at least <a href="7a2ebfe91946b6f514453ba87fa0b5e0.html" title="1934 in sports">1934</a>, when the Masters was founded, and still carried little weight in <a href="9b1a15861218890422b27ce728d1453d.html" title="1953 in sports">1953</a> when <a href="27aa1e49665eeb877f5684a0c3089b9d.html" title="Ben Hogan">Ben Hogan</a>, after winning the Masters, the US Open and The (British) Open, could not compete in the PGA Championship; the nearly concurrent PGA Championship and The (British) Open and the state of transatlantic travel made completing the Grand Slam impossible. Hogan is the only player to have won The Masters, the US and British opens in the same calendar year.</p> 
      <p><a href="4c813e60c7065367200f46a22aeaf072.html" title="Tiger Woods">Tiger Woods</a> has come closest to meeting the modern definition of golf's Grand Slam by holding all four modern major championships simultaneously — the US Open Championship, The (British) Open Championship and the PGA Championship in <a href="b1fa02aaa3bfb962e565b59057ae7087.html" title="2000 in sports">2000</a> and the <a href="4332f829e7248058d5666c331552ba19.html" title="2001 in sports">2001</a> Masters — although not in the same calendar year. This has been referred to as a <i>Consecutive Grand Slam</i> or, after the only player to achieve it, a <i>Tiger Slam</i>. In fact, even before Woods accomplished this, there was much debate over the definition of "Grand Slam". Fred Couples said "I don't know how I can put it more simply...if he wins all four, it's a Slam". As noted above, however, because there is no official definition, there is no definitive answer.</p> 
      <p>Only five golfers have won all four of golf's modern Majors at any time during their career, an achievement which is often referred to as a <i>Career Grand Slam</i>: <a href="ac61576bc4b26b60a32a577a010c9bb6.html" title="Gene Sarazen">Gene Sarazen</a>, <a href="a7e426d50b484c8c7084420243adea8e.html" title="Ben Hogan">Ben Hogan</a>, <a href="19f208fee6cbf79375d4e165cf8ae2fb.html" title="Gary Player">Gary Player</a>, <a href="60adf5100517e8243da1266106f0879e.html" title="Jack Nicklaus">Jack Nicklaus</a>, and <a href="ec2537962f25ee139b1839617b91297e.html" title="Tiger Woods">Tiger Woods</a>. Nicklaus has three Career Grand Slams, having won each major at least three times, while Woods has two, having won each major at least twice.</p> 
      <p>A number of dominant players of their eras have failed to achieve the Career Grand Slam because of their inability to win a particular major. <a href="4647f6cd86d8f0f903620a54ebd68014.html" title="Sam Snead">Sam Snead</a> failed to win a US Open; <a href="c43b744f751974768c0fcf0c747b32ab.html" title="Arnold Palmer">Arnold Palmer</a> and <a href="3ccd1b28dce70a6e2b98ccc7c10247f5.html" title="Tom Watson (golfer)">Tom Watson</a> failed to win a PGA Championship; <a href="bbb458e171bf881a96f1d8fd4b934485.html" title="Lee Trevino">Lee Trevino</a> failed to win The Masters. These shortcomings have been attributed to various concepts: a particular major is just ill-suited to a player's game; the player lacked the ability to fully adapt to that major; and the player experienced just sheer bad luck.</p>

      <p>Six women have completed the Career Grand Slam by winning four different majors. There are variations in the set of four tournaments involved as the players played in different eras, and the women's tournaments defined as "majors" have varied considerably over time in a way that has not been paralleled in the men's game. The six are <a href="4bf998a8b7334aa0dc4ce0174f58808b.html" title="Pat Bradley (golfer)">Pat Bradley</a>, <a href="49a179195056573128f6db38c6c07146.html" title="Juli Inkster">Juli Inkster</a>, <a href="8a9aea1dd1d8a5b35b2448f98ef93a88.html" title="Annika Sörenstam">Annika Sörenstam</a>, <a href="5f0de5f60c7b7374ff803a179401288f.html" title="Louise Suggs">Louise Suggs</a>, <a href="469035604ea3777b02b67051a3047d49.html" title="Karrie Webb">Karrie Webb</a>, and <a href="028bf36f5cf74a7351dd77a5c5cd6075.html" title="Mickey Wright">Mickey Wright</a>.

      <p>Senior (i.e., 50 and over) men's golf also has a set of <a href="22b5f04625dd9b7f01d05616cc13b630.html" title="Senior major golf championships">majors</a>.
