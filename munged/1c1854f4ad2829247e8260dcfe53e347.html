      <p>Pierce was born in <a href="0409ae0f110465e10305ce5c443c4779.html" title="South Connellsville, Pennsylvania">South Connellsville, Pennsylvania</a> in <a href="1f7179880f9b5baab817e582a87c9a8c.html" title="Fayette County, Pennsylvania">Fayette County</a>, on December 13, 1954. Her mother wanted to name her "Tamara" but the nurse who filled out her birth certificate misspelled it as "Tamora". When she was five her sister Kimberly (the person she based Alanna on) was born and a year later her second sister, Melanie, was born. From the time she was five until she was eight, she lived in <a href="e482d3074b9e60c795a363bc0799497d.html" title="Dunbar, Pennsylvania">Dunbar</a>. In June of 1963 she and her family moved to <a href="13b91128922a901d34c41a70bc3376bf.html" title="California">California</a>. Their first house in California was in <a href="9af4ef623ecff7e6c51a0b9834d0968b.html" title="San Mateo, California">San Mateo</a> on <a href="7ece9017c9c2133bf177662a4651efa3.html" title="El Camino Real">El Camino Real</a>. Their second was on the other side of the <a href="810cff3be4a66e39678dac91b5cf7d4c.html" title="San Francisco Peninsula">San Francisco peninsula</a>, in Miramar. They lived there for half a year, in <a href="cd78e476636d9587ab8c478e235f63b1.html" title="El Granada, California">El Granada</a> a full year, and then three years in <a href="050477019d92c8daf373af44b94cd7a8.html" title="Burlingame, California">Burlingame</a>.</p> 
      <p>She began reading when she was very young and started writing at about 6 years old. Her interest in fantasy and science fiction began when she was introduced to ‘<a href="7e136e24eeed7e2ea1a5892b5425abad.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>’ by <a href="e3d93f7984422e6beff5c81f93f13902.html" title="J. R. R. Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> and so she started to write the kind of books that she was reading. After her parents divorced, her mother moved Tamora and her sisters back to Fayette County in <a href="006f053f27cff38d44a260ef88eedd92.html" title="1969">1969</a>. She spent two years at Albert Gallatin Senior High. When her family moved again, she spent her senior year at Uniontown Area Senior High School, acting, singing, and writing for the school paper.</p> 
      <p>While at the <a href="e01f124e6685434b4131c5afeb659164.html" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> she wrote the books that became the <i><a href="3180628f34bd945cc62ae9692f2cbc14.html" title="The Song of the Lioness">The Song of the Lioness</a></i> quartet. The first book of this quartet, <i><a href="76ce7df50155b134e5f8c86d841f188c.html" title="Alanna: The First Adventure">Alanna: The First Adventure</a></i> was published by <a href="1fb7c88bebf9e1c5a1bd32da0bc31518.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Atheneum Books">Atheneum Books</a> in 1983.</p>

      <p>Tortall is a major country in the universe in which the Song of the Lioness, Immortals, Protector of the Small, Daughter of the Lioness and the Provost's Dog books take place. Its capital is Corus, located near the western coast on the Emerald Ocean. To the north is Scanra, a wild and somewhat barbaric country with whom Tortall went to war in the last two books of the Protector of the Small quartet and the first Daughter of the Lioness book, "Trickster's Choice." To the east are Galla, Tusaine, and Tyra, and past them are Maren and Sarain. Carthak is south of Tortall across the Inland Sea, while to the west lie the Yamani Islands and the Copper Isles. The Trickster books mostly take place in the Copper Isles, further south than the Yamani islands. In addition, <i>Emperor Mage</i> from the Immortals Quartet takes place in Carthak. Also, as the Provost's Dog books take place hundreds of years before the other books, Barzun, a nation between Tortall and the Inland Sea later conquered by Tortall, is occasionally mentioned.</p>

Although noble-born girls traditionally go to the convent to learn how to be proper noblewomen and wives, Alanna desires to become a knight, a position only given to noble-born boys (although, as seen in the Provost's Dog books, there had historically been other lady knights). In order to achieve her dream, Alanna disguises herself as a boy under the name of Alan and goes to the palace while her twin brother Thom goes to the convent to become a sorcerer. The twins' father is concerned only with his studies, and pays them little attention, which helps their masquerade, while their mother is dead. The series follows Alanna's training and the early years of her knighthood, a timespan of ten years.</p> 
      <p><i>The Song of The Lioness</i> was originally written as a single book for adults, but was rejected by the publisher. Pierce literally cut up the manuscript and used the pieces to form four new books for teenagers.</p>

She has an unusual (and extremely strong) talent that is initially mistaken for insanity. Though convinced she has no magical Gift, it is discovered that she has 'wild magic' - a magic that isn't uncommon, but for some reason is a disregarded branch of magic. What is rare is the amount of it that Daine possesses, and what she is able to do with it. This magic gives her a unique connection with animals. Her abilities manifest gradually throughout the series, allowing her first to speak with animals, to heal their injuries and eventually to shape-shift into animal forms. The series covers a timespan of four years, following Daine as she learns to communicate with humans, animals and <a href="7a6aa97641b76436dca68517f1d81c45.html" title="Legendary creature">Immortals</a>.</p>

      <p>George Cooper is a young boy (six) who is found stealing. His ashamed mother then tells him about his famous ancestor, named Rebekah Cooper. "Beka" Cooper is a trainee for the Provost's Guard, which is Tortall's equivalent of a police force. In those days, they were called "Dogs" and trainees were known as "Puppies" , both of whom were stationed at "Kennels" (which is where the term "Provost's Dog" comes from).</p> 
      <p>The first book in the new trilogy, Terrier, concerns Beka's first months as a Puppy. All of Tamora Pierce's previous books were written in the third person, but this series is told from a diary-style first person perspective. Beka's entries detail how hard she works to try to make her home, the Lower City of Corus, safer. Beka Cooper is also Tortall's first commoner protagonist. With the exception of Veralidaine Sarrasri, a foreigner, all the protagonists of the Tortall books have been members of the nobility.</p> 
      <p>Beka's roots in the Lower City give her both a keen insight and a sense of empathy for the people she is there to protect. Beka is referred to as a "Terrier" for her youth and dogged determination despite her size.</p>

The four youths do not fit in with the other children of the monastic community to which Niko brings them, and are put together in a separate cottage. Here they each learn of their hidden talents; Sandry with thread, Tris with weather, Daja with fire and metal, and Briar with plants. They live with the two mages Lark, a gentle woman especially attentive to Sandry since she also has thread magic, and Rosethorn, a sharp woman who shares Briar's ability with plants. Also teaching and guiding them is Niko, technically Tris's teacher, but available to all four. Daja is mentored and guided by Dedicate Initiate Frostpine, a smith mage. Their teachers, with the exception of Niko, are also ambient mages. At first it seems that a merchant, a street rat, a noblewoman, and a Trader (a trading race that is often hated by others) will never get along, but an extraordinary circumstance brings them together. They are all powerful individually, but they discover that together they are even stronger. Through an earthquake, they realize their full potential and are bound closely together forever. As children skilled in an uncommon magic, they struggle to earn the respect of the adults they encounter.</p>

      <p>The initial working title for this book was <i>The Circle Reforged</i>.</p> 
      <p>Sandry's cousin, the Empress of Namorn (Berenene dor Ocmor), has been begging her to come visit her for years. Finally the stitch witch agrees, but her uncle requests that her childhood friends accompany her. However, during the time they were separated the foursome has broken apart, and are now adults with secrets that they once would have shared. Sandry expects to visit her cousin for the summer then return home to her uncle in Emelan, but the Empress has other plans. As the four soon find out, the iron will of the Empress is considered law, and the four must set aside their doubts and trust each other as they once did if they are to escape.</p>

       <li><i>The Will of the Empress</i> (UK October 2005, <a href="e42d67aa14557c9b6367fad4a5cd5db7.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-439-44171-4</a>; US November 2005, <a href="bff660b3fb5b2226e8886951e05f3840.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-439-44171-4</a>)</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>It is hinted at throughout this book and finally explained that Briar and Rosethorn had significant adventures in Gyongxe, the first home of the Living Circle temples: although Tamora Pierce's website lists the publication of the book concerning this period as 2009, she has mentioned on <a href="c0da4d3f8c50235ea758796246c54831.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sheroescentral.com/" rel="nofollow">Sheroes Central</a> that it was set for release in 2007.</p> 
      <p>The reader is also informed that Tris will be enrolling at the mages' university in Lightsbridge under an <a href="2198f10618c14d5ab92f98ee4172133e.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Assumed name">assumed name</a>, in an attempt to become an ordinary mage practicing normal academic magic (spells, charms, potions) with no one knowing her real name or power. This decision was reached after Tris realised that most of her prospective employers only wanted to use her weather craft as war magic. This story will also to be told in a later book listed for release in 2009.</p> 
      <p>Briar is tempeted by the chances and plants he could work with at the Empresses' place and finds it hard to stay with his friends.</p> 
      <p>Readers also find out that Daja finds love in a female employee of the Empresses' and are hinted that Rosethorn and Lark may have been involved too, either with each other or someone else.</p>

      <p>Set at the same time as <i>The Will of the Empress</i>, this tells the story of Rosethorn and Evvy when they travel to the Battle Islands: the inhabitants report that their plants and trees and the animals who live around them are dying off in patches, for no discernible reason. They are accompanied by a dedicate initiate from Winding Circle, named Mertide, and Evvy's rock friend Luvo, whom she met while she, Rosethorn, and Briar were traveling in Yanjing.</p>

      <p>On her homepage, Pierce states she gets most ideas from things she stumbles upon. Her concept of magic as a tapestry of threads comes from her experiences in crocheting, and in her world, all mages are somehow based on British naturalist <a href="6159ff71ade54f4e0d8d4493ff30e63a.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Sir David Attenborough">Sir David Attenborough</a> after watching his nature documentaries. Fantasy novels and <a href="d519de58272f66be440744a7798c0a53.html" title="Arthurian legend">Arthurian legend</a> were the base of the worlds she thought up as a girl, and later she added contemporary issues like youth crime, <a href="930c33e9c2b8bb1d3ca07a66320211e3.html" title="Cholera">cholera</a> outbreaks in Africa and mistreatment of females by the <a href="64a6a06aff448c992af4e155c2d1cd9d.html" title="Taliban">Taliban</a>. In general, Pierce states: "The best way to prepare to have ideas when you need them is to listen to and encourage your obsessions."<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="1c95ed93d937b3b25318a84e366e2d77.html" title="">[1]</a></sup></p> 
      <p>For aspiring writers, Pierce also tells you can circumvent a feared writer's block by introducing a new character who is bold and different from the rest, adding something dramatic to shake things up (i.e. an accident, a storm, an elopement), changing the point of view, writing something else while your main story is seemingly impossible to write or talking to friends about your book. Finally, if none of the above techniques work, Pierce suggests mercy-killing your story if you know it won't become anything worthwhile, and taking comfort in the notion you will avoid some errors the next time.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="f33afcb7b98daf2368901a19405bbd47.html" title="">[2]</a></sup></p> 
      <p>Pierce is also known for bringing in an unusual amount of sex and violence into her teenager books. She explains that it sticks close to historical past, in which people were married at 14 and had children soon after. In regards to premarital teenager sex, which also happens in her books, she states that all her heroines who engage in sexual relations do so only with <a href="217512ae373f28d86c0c45af1d5f9f03.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Contraception">contraception</a> (i.e. some magic charm which prevents <a href="765538e12ef104dd838d5915d3948991.html" title="Pregnancy">pregnancy</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="5a7ecd5cd2352f5f25dd3df473511dbf.html" title="">[3]</a></sup> Finally, Pierce states that violence sadly has been a bane in all times, and even today there are social hot spots in big cities, people are exploited in sweatshops, and the slave trade remains active. She thinks that smugly ignoring these facts is irresponsible, and is quoted saying: "We <i>need</i> to face it [cruelty and violence], even in books. Even in fantasy."<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="a5ea9b28082dd681d6c0d8e42c78f804.html" title="">[4]</a></sup></p> 
      <p>Pierce draws on elements of people and animals around her to inspire her characters. The character of Alanna is loosely based on Pierce's sister, and the villain Duke Roger is based on an ex-boyfriend. Thayet's appearance is based on a friend of Pierce's. Beka's pigeon friends in <i>Provost's Dog</i> are all based on actual pigeons of Pierce's acquaintance.</p>
