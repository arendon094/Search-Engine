      <p><b>Age fabrication</b> occurs when an individual deliberately misrepresents his or her true age. It is usually practised with the intent to garner privileges or status that would not otherwise be available to the individual. This can be accomplished by making oral or written statements, by using falsified documents, or by altering archives of <a href="d47fbaec43c5db5d8a04bfe6d5369210.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Vital records">vital records</a>.</p> 
      <p>For example, until the early 1950s in <a href="891767ff2be31c9a00f7592e4c27e471.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> it was extremely common for <a href="0644901a2ccf3bdafaabd7f8ef963c52.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Actresses">actresses</a> to subtract at least one year from their actual age. On some occasions, age is increased so as to make cutoffs for minimum legal or employable age in <a href="e349ef94ef533863258c40a58d528b05.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Showbusiness">showbusiness</a> or <a href="1ffd1f29853f0b775667802600ab4388.html" title="Professional sports">professional sports</a>. There are many stories of men lying about their age to join the armed forces, for example to fight in <a href="8e047af82fc6ef3c128a96e79425fcf7.html" title="World War I">World War I</a> <a href="e565e14b34dacc15e9423bb8f77842dc.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.1914-1918.net/recruitment.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Sometimes it is not the people themselves who lower their public age, but others around them such as <a href="8240845423e872691cd8e43829d52dbd.html" title="Publicist">publicists</a>, parents, and other handlers.

Most cases involve taking or adding one or two years to their age. However, in more extreme case such as with <a href="132122b6f7da0f4e505853a244165242.html" title="Al Lewis (actor)">Al Lewis</a> and <a href="57749a6a6251097f27a917cf7d9f0e33.html" title="Charo">Charo</a>, a decade has been added or subtracted.</p>
