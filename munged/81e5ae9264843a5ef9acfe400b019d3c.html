      <h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="4af562c565eda83e207ad975ffdc64a5.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h2> 
      <p>Dundee Schools Music Theatre (commonly known as DSMT) was formed in 1998 by Lina Waghorn. The original idea was to bring young people together from all of Dundee's secondary schools to perform - a unique project in Scotland. After discussions with Dundee's Director of Education Anne Wilson, it was decided that the project would be set up on a trial basis for a year. Success in the trial year would secure further funding from the council. The first show performed by DSMT was Guys and Dolls. The show played to capacity crowds at Dundee's Whitehall Theatre in August 1998. The success of this initial performance secured financial commitment from the city council and DSMT has grown from strength to strength ever since.</p> 
      <p>The next year, DSMT were amongst the few acts specially chosen to perform in the Millennium Dome, London. Sponsored by McDonalds, a cast of 80 flew to London to be part of the national millennium celebrations.</p> 
      <p>In 2001, DSMT made its debut performance at the Edinburgh International Fringe. The production of Stephen Schwartz's Godspell received rave revues from the press and Fringe Magazine.</p> 
      <p>Dundee Schools Music Theatre began a partnership with the Whitehall Theatre in 2002. This was beneficial to both parties and further supported the dedicated performing arts programme that Dundee City Council Education Department employs. DSMT has also been supported by The Scottish Arts Council and National Lottery.</p> 
      <p>2003 presented DSMT with its biggest and most exciting challenge yet. The group were awarded the rights to perform the epic Les Mis√©rables. The performance was the North East premier of the show and attracted much media attention as well as a visit from the Education Minister. The show opened at the Whitehall Theatre on <a href="93da1f09f10c713deaeb0713ccf7b91d.html" title="August 23">August 23</a>, <a href="0143de98b85911958d52e12bdf10e7df.html" title="2003">2003</a> and the run had completely sold out within a week.</p> 
      <p>2003 also saw the formation of DSMT's sister group, Back to Back. The success of the original project was such, that it was decided expansion was necessary. Back to Back allowed pupils to remain with the organisation for a year after they left school. This "post development" project furthered the learning achieved by members as part of the original group.</p> 
      <p>Back to Back's first project was Side by Side by Sondheim - a musical review of Sondheim's work. Back to Back began with only four cast members and success such as that enjoyed by the main group was far from assured. However, the original performances in Dundee and Arbroath were received with critical acclaim and the show transferred to the Edinburgh Fringe in 2004. Soon after it's Edinburgh run, the production went international with further performances in Wurzburg, Germany and Washington D.C, USA. Songs from the production were also played on BBC Radio Scotland. The runaway success of Side by Side by Sondheim secured Back to Back's future and it's important place within the Structure of Dundee Schools Music Theatre. By 2004, Back to Back had expanded to 40 cast members.</p> 
      <p>While Back to Back flourished, DSMT continued to impress audiences both locally and nationally. 2004 saw a production of Cy Coleman's circus musical Barnum and in 2005, an entirely new production of Joseph And The Amazing Technicoloured dreamcoat was staged. Soon After, DSMT expanded even further. A junior section was added which allowed first and second year pupils to be part of the project. This group perform their own annual shows in May.</p> 
      <p>Dundee Schools Music Theatre Continues to provide excellent theatrical training and a life changing experience for the young people involved in the project. Recent productions have included 42nd Street, Hot Mikado, Chess, The Pajama Game and The Boyfriend (which also played at the Edinburgh Fringe).</p> 
      <p>Dundee Schools Music Theatre celebrates its 10th year in 2008.</p>

      <p>Dundee Schools Music Theatre currently employs a team of trained professionals to work on its production team.</p> 
      <p><b>Producer</b> Lina Waghorn has produced shows for DSMT since its formation in 1998. A trained ballet dancer, Lina has been involved in theatre since her childhood. In 2006 she took over the role of producer for Sounds Spectacular - the highly popular review show, well known for it's long association with John Scrimgeor.</p> 
      <p><b>Director</b> Kenny Christie has worked with the project for 6 years. Also a professional dancer and choreographer, he is perhaps the most sought-after director in the East of Scotland. As well as DSMT, Kenny has worked on other notable productions such as We Will Rock You.</p> 
      <p><b>Musical Director</b> Paul Clancy is one of the busiest Musical Directors working in Scotland. He conducts up to ten shows each year as well as continuing his work as an arranger and session musician. Paul took over from John Scrimgeor as Musical Director of Sounds Spectacular in 2006. He has been M.D for Dundee Schools Music Theatre since 2000.</p> 
      <p><b>Assistant Musical Director</b> Richard Waghorn is a professional pianist and arranger. Richard studied piano at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama under renowned pianist Fali Pavri. Also a busy session player, Richard appears on many recordings and is a founder member of the band Celtic Rouge. He has worked on many productions throughout the UK and became Musical Director of DSMT's Junior group in 2006.</p>

      <p>Dundee Schools Music Theatre is based in <b>The Music Centre</b>, Dundee. The building is owned by the City Council and was refurbished into a top class rehearsal facility for DSMT which is second to none. The impressive building houses a concert hall, rehearsal halls, scenery store, archive and wardrobe. It also boasts a Yamaha grand piano.</p> 
      <p>The Music Centre has been the home of Dundee Schools Music Theatre since 1999 housing rehearsals, recordings and photo shoots. 42nd Street rehearsals were briefly moved from the Music Centre in 2006. This was due to the worries the first floor hall would be put under strain by the large amount of tap dancing required for the production. The large administrative task of running DSMT is carried out away from the Music Centre at city council headquarters, Tayside House and DSMT headquarters at Forfar Road.</p>

      <p>Dundee Schools music Theatre are currently working on a 10th anniversary gala performance entitled Celebration. The production runs at the Whitehall Theatre in September 2008.</p> 
      <p>Back to Back will stage Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar in August 2008, also at Dundee's Whitehall Theatre.</p>
