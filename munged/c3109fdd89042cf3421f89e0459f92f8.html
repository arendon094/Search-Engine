      <p>Unlike most comic series, the plot of <i>Kabuki</i> moves very little over the course of the volumes. Very little fast-paced or violent action takes place, instead most of the focus is on memories, dreams, thoughts and philosophy. Mack's characters, especially Kabuki herself, revisit the same scenes and memories many times, rethinking them and their significance.</p> 
      <p>Mack uses a myriad of art styles, not only with pencil, ink, and color, but with paint, magazine clippings, manga scans, and crayons. In <i>Kabuki: The Alchemy</i> especially, many of the pages are photos (or color scans) of collages, using a variety of materials; for example, the fingers of Japanese sandalwood fans become the borders of the comic panels. One technique he uses often is reusing the same artwork, the same scenes, to represent a characters' memories, or simply to shift scene back to something the reader has already seen. Imagery is very important and prominent in the series; Mack reuses the same images, often changing them slightly, and focusing on the emotional content of images and the power of memories.</p> 
      <p>Mack does not always do the art for these comics alone. In "Kabuki: Masks of the Noh" a different artist was assigned to each agent as a way of visually representing their personalities. This continued in "Kabuki: Scarab," which was written by Mack with art by Rick Mays, who had previously drawn Scarab in "Masks of the Noh."</p>

      <p>The main character, codenamed <b>Kabuki</b>, is the granddaughter of a former <a href="9343f76cbf8b7f6bbd633ee3a517b4c3.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> Japanese military man known as <b>"General Kai"</b> and an <a href="38577ed14454b3911d260a0b1f977f8b.html" title="Ainu people">Ainu</a> <a href="a87140121ab2a84bc3d0f8a8d87e3886.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Comfort woman">comfort woman</a>. While working for the <b>Noh Assassins</b>, she experiences much conflict with her life and personal identity.</p> 
      <p>In the beginning, Kabuki and the <b>Noh</b> are controlled by two masked men, who are known as the <b>Devil</b> and <b>Dove</b>, although the group serves the Company, lead by the General. The Noh is charged with the control and elimination of various <a href="190aae700001a6de199d12a470df0092.html" title="Yakuza">yakuza</a> groups in Japan, especially the yakuza organization of <b>Ryuichi Kai</b>.</p> 
      <p>However, Kai is powerful politically, and important to the Noh to keep alive for the time being. For her own personal reasons, and at the request of Dove, Kabuki goes against the General's orders and kills Kai and his gang. The Board of Directors of the Noh demand she be punished for her disobedience, and she massacres them before dying herself. She is revived, and brought to a facility run by the Control Corps, a combination prison and mental hospital where rogue agents can be reprogrammed. Her former associates, the assassins of the Noh, are sent to eliminate her, but she escapes, and takes on a new identity.</p>

      <p>All Noh assassins bear a dragon tattoo on the back. The wings spread to cover the range of both shoulders, while the tail reaches to lower back area. A bulletproof kabuki mask covers the face to conceal the identity. Boots and utility belts are included. The eyes of the mask are connected to a red visor, which allows the assassin to share their vision with the Noh <a href="f699b5a420c75a1db8cf66c4e19dae79.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Via">via</a> camera-link, all while processing data.</p> 
      <p>The general color and clothing is black leather and silk, which makes it easy for an assassin to avoid detection while moving about in shadows and darkness. The silk is mostly used to cover the arms to conceal arm movements. The body armor worn is bulletproof. All assassin have individual designs to suit them.</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Spikes are worn as part of <b>Scarab's</b> assassin garb, because her armor design is based on a sketch that Yukio drew in his spare time. This was done in loving memory and tribute. This appearance may be considered the most fancy look among the eight assassins.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>The Noh assassins are highly skilled with Neo-Warsaw-Nato firearms, Okinawan <a href="0d90d9a604f96d58dc067861f342aabe.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Black market">black market</a> weaponry, hand-to-hand combat, and attack and defense using the environment. The preferred weapons of choice are usually handguns, and various bladed weapons. The long fingernails are sometimes dipped in poisoned nail polish. Each assassin has her own favorite weapons that she normally prefers to carry out her missions.</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li><b>Kabuki's</b> primary weapons are a pair of poisoned twin <a href="b91bd719b7b06d7a9f6b4f5e35d9312a.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Sickles">sickles</a> which are shaped as Ainu farm tools, as tribute and loving memory of her mother.</li>

She and Scarab are the two main characters in Kabuki. Kabuki is a beautiful yet tragic young woman codenamed, for the words "kabuki" being scarred on her face. Her real name is Ukiko. Although her last name is never revealed, but it is possible that her full name would be <b>Ukiko Kai</b>. She constantly struggles for her identity, while carrying out missions.</p> 
      <p><b>Scarab</b> is another assassin, who is widely considered as the second main character. Her real name is Keiko. The codename Scarab was given to her, because it is her duty to clean up the mistakes of the other Noh assassins, very much like the characteristics of the <a href="98404f71775ffc02adc4d71a1984841c.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Scarab beetle">scarab beetle</a>. She once lived in an orphanage and ran away to survive on the streets, alongside her friend Sieko. Her time on the streets mostly consisted of vandalizing both public and personal property, such as soda machines and motorcycles. Due to her popularity as a socialite, she has little or no problem meeting people, and acquiring knowledge on different groups in society. Along with the dragon tattoo on her back that all Noh assassins receive, she also has <a href="a068991a5147e2664053db83012dc450.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Tribal">tribal</a> <a href="f46889ba04132c900736d84be3058a48.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Tattoos">tattoos</a> which she acquired on both hips.

      <p>The original vision that Mack had for the overall story was for each assassin to have their own <b>Kabuki: Agent</b> series, inside the main story of Ukiko. The agent installments would serve to show the individual lives and perspectives for each of Ukiko's fellow assassins.</p> 
      <p>However, for currently unknown reasons, only Kabuki: Scarab which is Keiko's own story is complete. As a result, Keiko is widely considered and received by many readers as the second main character. The possible reason for this reaction would be the fact that she and Ukiko are the only Noh assassins with individual stories, and perspectives within the realm of Kabuki.</p> 
      <p>Another reason would be that unlike the rest of Kabuki, the side story of Keiko's life has more of a faster pace and is more action-oriented. Among many readers, her popularity is quite possibly larger than Ukiko's.</p>
