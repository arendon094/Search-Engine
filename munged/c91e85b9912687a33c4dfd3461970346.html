      <p>On the day of the murders, at around 18:15, Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman had had a barbecue at Holly's family home and shortly after they went out to fetch some sweets. On their travels they walked past Huntley's rented house in College Close. Huntley asked them to come into the house. He said that Carr was in the house as well, although in fact she had gone to visit family back in <a href="2b1068ce2e551f7507eac9b4cee1d652.html" title="Grimsby">Grimsby</a>. Shortly after Wells and Chapman entered 5 College Close, Huntley murdered them. It is said that Holly was drowned in the bath, and Jessica was suffocated with a pillow<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&nbsp;since June 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="ac10e26e1b530e2b2026ff490b363a66.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p> 
      <p>Huntley's reasons for committing the murders may never be known, but minutes before seeing the girls, Huntley had slammed the telephone down on Carr after a furious argument. Huntley had allegedly suspected Carr of cheating on him. The police suspect that Huntley killed the girls in a fit of jealous rage. There may have also been a sexual motive. It seems likely that either, or possibly both, of these motives drove Huntley to kill the girls. The police found no evidence of preplanning, and later said that they would have expected to find it if it were there.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&nbsp;since June 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="f46889ba04132c900736d84be3058a48.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>

      <p>Ian Huntley's mental state was then assessed as to whether he suffered from a mental illness or not, and if he was fit to stand trial. This assessment took place at Rampton High Secure Hospital and was carried out by consultant psychiatrist, Dr. Christopher Clark. Dr. Clark stated in court that:</p>

      <p>This left Huntley facing life imprisonment if a jury could be convinced of his guilt.</p> 
      <p>Huntley's defence conceded that he disposed of the girls' bodies and that they were in his house when they died. However, he claimed that Holly Wells accidentally fell in the bath and drowned and that Jessica Chapman was then so distressed that he had to restrain her to stop her screaming, but accidentally did this so forcefully that she too died. This led him to plead guilty to the lesser charge of <a href="3b7a2e713ce59b3e7f14609c719d2dcd.html" title="Manslaughter in English law">manslaughter</a>, but the jury rejected his story and found him guilty of the murder of both girls.</p>

      <p>The search for the two girls and the subsequent trial generated intense media interest and speculation, ensuring that the names and faces of Huntley and Carr became well-known across the <a href="6d9aa7ebdad9f4e8c881986082f8b67d.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and worldwide.</p>

      <p>At first Huntley was sentenced to two life terms in prison.

      <p>Huntley was among the last of more than 500 life sentence prisoners waiting to have minimum terms set by the Lord Chief Justice after the Home Secretary's tariff-setting procedures were declared illegal.

      <p>In February 1999, Huntley (then 25) met 22-year-old <a href="24e570786fc7b0aced15d498c8864650.html" title="Maxine Carr">Maxine Carr</a> at Hollywood's nightclub in <a href="891a24a013fe4749d398ea04b291f0be.html" title="Grimsby">Grimsby</a> town centre.

      <p>Regardless of how the girls died, Huntley disposed of their bodies in a ditch 20 miles away and set them alight in a bid to destroy the <a href="8c445a98b0b86beb8b2c568afda356b6.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Forensics">forensic</a> evidence.

      <p>When the girls were first reported missing, Huntley was not the police's prime suspect, as on the same day that the two girls were reported as missing, the body of another man was found on a nearby railway line - he was believed to have committed suicide. However, it was later discovered that this was a simply a coincidence, and that this man was not involved in the girls' disappearance, but had in fact died several hours earlier in a completely unrelated incident.</p>

He was faced with two murder charges, while Carr was charged with perverting the course of justice and assisting an offender. Huntley admitted that the girls had died in his house, but claimed that he had accidentally knocked Holly into the bath while helping her control a nosebleed and had accidentally <a href="7558133f1c1852af8fbd3ff3ffd0da4b.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Suffocation">suffocated</a> Jessica when she started to scream.

Carr was cleared of assisting an offender but found guilty of perverting the course of justice and jailed for three and a half years, but she was freed under police protection after just 5 months because she had already spent 16 months on remand. She was provided with a new identity and lives under police protection after leaving prison on <a href="6e9f12729ebe7156590cdb061885c487.html" title="May 10">10 May</a> <a href="9d9a657b083d2bc7f4dcc2a319944594.html" title="2004">2004</a>.</p> 
      <p>After Huntley was convicted, it was revealed that he had been investigated in the past for sexual offences and burglary, but had still been allowed to work in a school. None of these investigations had resulted in a conviction. Indeed, Huntley's only previous conviction was for riding a motorcycle without a licence or insurance (an offence for which he had been convicted in <a href="28328e679e8792c6b22e4466dc976a31.html" title="1993">1993</a>).</p>

The inquiry criticised Humberside Police for deleting information relating to previous allegations against Huntley and criticised Cambridgeshire Police for not following vetting guidelines. An added complication in the vetting procedures was the fact that Huntley had applied for the caretaker's job under the name of Ian Nixon, although he did state on the application form that he was once known as Ian Huntley. It is believed that Humberside Police either did not check under the name Huntley on the police computer - if they had then they would have discovered a burglary charge left on file - or did not check at all.</p> 
      <p>Since being jailed, Huntley has repeatedly admitted that he lied when giving evidence at his trial. He changed his story about the death of Jessica, having previously admitted to suffocating her in a panic. An <a href="b236623a11084e1a60700ece86dca902.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Audio tape">audio tape</a> recording of Huntley speaking to a relative at <a href="993fadcc0eebe8ff6c833d543f546f26.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Wakefield Prison">Wakefield Prison</a> revealed that he allegedly killed her when she tried to call for help on her mobile phone.</p>

The beginning of his sentence was backdated to October 2002, when he was first remanded in custody — not August 2002, as he was initially held in a mental hospital before a judge decided he was fit to stand trial.</p> 
      <p>Under this ruling, Huntley is expected to remain behind bars until at least October 2042 and the age of 68. In March <a href="387e23fd79c8c088bc85ad51f41c2d03.html" title="2007">2007</a>, the <a href="9b1a15861218890422b27ce728d1453d.html" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> sparked controversy when he said in a <a href="9a370ecf13f9d176a64302f5d2f7aa94.html" title="Sunday Telegraph">Sunday Telegraph</a> interview that Huntley is among a number of prisoners who should never be released as "that is what the public expect".<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="067cbc2d25b9ac69ab8e023409ec62b4.html" title="">[2]</a></sup></p> 
      <p>The families of Huntley's victims later revealed that they had been hoping for a whole life tariff to be set, but Huntley's sentence was approximately three times heavier than the minimum terms imposed on most convicted murderers.</p> 
      <p>The Wells and Chapman families received £11,000 in compensation for the death of their daughters, which was widely criticised in the media.

      <p>Following the announcement of Huntley's conviction, it emerged that various authorities were aware of allegations, from a number of sources, that he had committed one act of <a href="28542f74217f66dcd495c3a3f0d6ba25.html" title="Indecent assault">indecent assault</a>, four acts of <a href="e82a6bdd16585286ec413f40d53d1f28.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Underage sex">underage sex</a> and three <a href="36a1ebd085e178a5d51030c5e6d84755.html" title="Rape">rape</a>.</p> 
      <p>The only one of these allegations that resulted in a charge was a rape, and the charge was dropped before it could reach court. Huntley had also been charged with burglary, but he was not convicted, although the charge remained on file. On the day of Huntley's conviction, the <a href="d78bc168b97003f00fbf3397cea63054.html" title="Home Secretary">Home Secretary</a> <a href="4ca6a2f9f418d46509e7d05ba678992a.html" title="David Blunkett">David Blunkett</a> announced an inquiry into the <a href="c894d30d99a41f6749c9fb6a2984f8eb.html" title="Criminal Records Bureau">vetting system</a> which allowed Huntley to get a caretaker's job at a school despite four separate complaints about him reaching <a href="ed15eaadb239b53eacf687d8a42031c9.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Social services">social services</a>. One of the pertinent issues surfaced almost immediately when Humberside police (where all the alleged offences had taken place) stated that they believed that it was unlawful under the <a href="bae24fa272b99ff7c86a1228b350bdd0.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Data Protection Act 1984">Data Protection Act</a> to hold data regarding allegations which did not lead to a conviction; this was contradicted by other police forces who thought this too strict an interpretation of the Act.</p> 
      <p>There was also considerable concern about the police investigation into these murders. It took nearly two weeks before the police became aware of previous sexual allegations against Ian Huntley, and despite him being the last person to see either of the two children, his story was not effectively checked out early during the investigation.</p> 
      <p>Huntley had not been convicted of any of the underage sex, indecent assault or rape allegations, but his burglary charge had remained on file. Mr Howard Gilbert, the then head teacher of Soham Village College, later said that he would not have employed Huntley as a caretaker if he had been aware of the burglary charge, as one of Huntley's key responsibilities in his role was to ensure security in the school grounds.</p>

He said that he killed Jessica after she tried to flee once she had realised her friend had been killed elsewhere in the house.</p> 
      <p>Huntley also claimed that he couldn't live with the guilt of what he had done, and that he planned on committing suicide.</p> 
      <p>Huntley added that Carr had told him to burn the girls' bodies after he murdered them, a claim which contradicted the jury's opinion that Carr was not guilty of assisting an offender and had not known that Huntley had committed the murders.</p>

      <p>The inquiry also recommends a registration scheme for people working with children and vulnerable adults, like the elderly. It also suggested a national system should be set up for police forces to share intelligence information. The report said there should also be a clear code of practice on record-keeping by all police forces.</p>

      <p><a href="65e6f78eb06e014a98127c6edd99cce4.html" title="Michael Bichard">Sir Michael Bichard</a>'s report severely criticised the Chief Constable of <a href="1418e6d770f02aca676e13bdbc5c905b.html" title="Humberside">Humberside</a> Police, David Westwood, for ordering the destruction of criminal records of child abusers. Though supported by <a href="60b5d0cce006bc56bcb8ac3d582a93b2.html" title="Humberside">Humberside</a> Police Authority, he was suspended by then <a href="8332dc29deed31b4d14866d106b9ef2a.html" title="Home Secretary">Home Secretary</a> <a href="c2a51ecf433f42b7c47669c6632f2d7b.html" title="David Blunkett">David Blunkett</a>, using powers granted under the Police Reform Act 2002 to order suspension as "necessary for the maintenance of public confidence in the force in question". The suspension was later lifted, with Westwood agreeing to retire a year early, in <a href="8627ad0ef900e3c1a427274903d531a2.html" title="March 2005">March 2005</a>.</p> 
      <p>The Chief Constable of <a href="1c2f5f29068d38cdc96fa1959fd0b487.html" title="Cambridgeshire">Cambridgeshire</a> Police, Tom Lloyd had also been criticised, as his force had failed to contact <a href="ba92e1083408b31e24520488e8b02038.html" title="Humberside">Humberside</a> Police during the vetting procedure. Lloyd was criticised by the police inspectorate for being slow to cut a holiday short after the investigation had become the largest in the force's history. The inspectorate also criticised a 'lack of grip' on the investigation, which included nationally televised appeals by both footballer <a href="28489e39e56724f9c1411e76dc3db047.html" title="David Beckham">David Beckham</a> and Detective Superintendent David Beck, who announced that he had left a message for abductors on Jessica's mobile phone before the case was taken from him.</p> 
      <p>Another complication was that two of the <a href="680edc4272d742255ccec1ff9cfd3ff4.html" title="Cambridgeshire">Cambridgeshire</a> police officers involved with the families of the murdered girls had become <a href="b9a97a997aedbdea313b326cc73f3865.html" title="Operation Ore">Operation Ore</a> suspects a month before the murders. Antony Goodridge, one of the exhibits officers, later pleaded guilty to <a href="c0da4d3f8c50235ea758796246c54831.html" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a> offences and was given a six-month sentence. Detective Constable Brian Stevens, who had read a poem at the girls' memorial service, was cleared of charges of <a href="af08420bc0a0e922877d5049bad664ac.html" title="Indecent assault">indecent assault</a> and <a href="198b0f84cc260316d57bbe6e772638b2.html" title="Child pornography">child pornography</a> offences after the poor presentation of prosecution evidence by computer expert Brian Underhill caused the trial to be stopped. Stevens was later convicted of a charge of <a href="3a1166244e8e70c0c21b03cf09d992dd.html" title="Perverting the course of justice">perverting the course of justice</a> after it was proved that he had given a false <a href="4e267482ce92a58e98a4130a9eaa738b.html" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Alibi">alibi</a> to clear himself of the charges, and was imprisoned for eight months. The Stevens case may have affected other <a href="a3493eef5a69442a2153db9bcd6de7fd.html" title="Operation Ore">Operation Ore</a> inquiries.</p> 
      <p>Tom Lloyd announced his resignation in June <a href="5c90ffe6e5c21691eb0d187eb9251426.html" title="2005">2005</a> following accusations that he had become extremely drunk at the Association of Chief Police Officers' annual conference and had pestered a senior female official.</p>
