      <p><b>Earthwatch Institute</b> is an international <a href="e42f1aee7b12f445f52c25616db8351d.html" title="Non-profit organization">non-profit organization</a> that was founded in 1971 near <a href="b236623a11084e1a60700ece86dca902.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>.</p> 
      <p>Their mission is to engage people worldwide in scientific field research and education to promote the understanding and action necessary for a sustainable environment. Earthwatch works with a wide range of partners, from individuals who work as conservation volunteers on research teams through to corporate partners, governments and institutions.</p> 
      <p>It does this in a number of ways. Every year, Earthwatch sends over 4,000 volunteers from around the world on scientific field research projects focused on such critical issues as sustainability and climate change. Earthwatch also collaborates with over 50 global partner organisations on their conservation and management plans; builds networks of students and teachers to share expedition based-based curriculum and lesson plans; communicates with scientists about proposed research projects, findings and research results; and engages corporate partners and thousands of individuals to support its mission.</p> 
      <p>Earthwatch aims to create systematic change in the way the public views science and its role in environmental sustainability, working under the premise that conservation decisions should be based upon solid data from the field. Earthwatch also advocates <a href="92a2a3586e86423d7806820f54e2b04a.html" title="Sustainable tourism">sustainable tourism</a> and the shift to low-carbon or <a href="9c265e160651855594a017c05c91d8cf.html" title="Sustainable energy">sustainable energy</a> sources.</p> 
      <p>The next ten years will be critical to our efforts to build the path toward a sustainable future, and the window for effecting substantive change will close if we don’t act aggressively now. As such, over the next decade Earthwatch has outlined an ambitious, action-oriented plan to: • Raise and distribute $100 million to fund scientific field research • Engage 50,000 people directly in field research • Inspire our volunteers to create 35,000 local community action projects • Touch the lives of 10 million people worldwide</p>

      <p>Earthwatch currently has offices in the US, UK, Australia and Japan. Since its founding in 1971, the organization has supported nearly 1,350 projects in 120 countries and 35 states. More than 90,000 volunteers have contributed $67 million and 11 million hours to scientific fieldwork. In 2008, Earthwatch will sponsor 130 research projects in more than 40 countries and 20 US states, making estimated volunteer field grants of $5 million.</p> 
      <p>An arm of the Earthwatch Institute is the Corporate Environmental Responsibility Group (CERG), founded by Earthwatch (Europe). CERG offers a platform for enhancing good practice amongst the business sector.</p> 
      <p>--</p> 
      <p><b>The Research Program</b></p> 
      <p>Earthwatch is one of the world’s largest private funders of scientific research. We support field research that focuses on four key areas identified as priorities by the global scientific community: climate change, oceans, sustainable resource management, and sustainable cultures. Earthwatch's Research Program supports scientists from around the world, including developing countries. We place a high priority on identifying opportunities to support women in science as well as long-term monitoring projects. Earthwatch receives roughly 400 inquiries each year from scholars with labor-intensive research in need of funds and volunteer assistance. Projects are chosen for support with the help of independent peer reviewers based on how well they fit the Earthwatch mission, their scholarly quality, and their potential to significantly contribute to sustainability. Project results are published in hundreds of scholarly journals worldwide and shared with partner organizations, government agencies, and policy-makers. Find past grant recipients and application guidelines at www.earthwatch.org/research.</p> 
      <p><b>The Conservation Program</b></p> 
      <p>Earthwatch promotes the establishment of strategic international and community partnerships in conjunction with multi-disciplinary research projects in some of the world's outstanding areas of ecological and cultural value. Earthwatch Conservation Research Initiatives (CRIs) are flagship projects that have addressed complex environmental issues in Australia, Kenya, Brazil, and Belize. In each CRI, local conservation needs and goals are collaboratively defined with partner organizations, local community members, and environmental organizations. Subsequently, Earthwatch works to achieve these goals by supporting data collection, capacity-building, and community-based activities. By engaging communities in setting priorities and securing their investment throughout the process, Earthwatch implements an effective community-based conservation model. Find more on CRIs at www.earthwatch.org/conservation.</p> 
      <p><b>The Education Program</b></p> 
      <p>Earthwatch is a respected leader in the field of experiential education. To date, more than 3,700 students and 4,500 classroom teachers have received career training through Earthwatch expeditions. Fellowships funded by individuals, foundations, and corporations allow educators to teach "live" from the field using the latest communications technology, which enables them to improve the quality of education in classrooms nationwide. Student fellowships give students the unique opportunity to participate first-hand in scientific research—instilling in tomorrow’s leaders a powerful sense of civic and environmental awareness, and inspiring many of them to even pursue science as a career. Other fellowships offer zookeepers the chance to enhance their knowledge of animals in the wild. In addition, through our Capacity Building Program we work with emerging conservationists in developing countries to build their teaching and research capacities and bolster their ability to share skills and ideas. For example, the African Fellowship Program has enabled more than 1,000 scientists, teachers, and conservation leaders to gain professional development on projects. Find more info and applications at www.earthwatch.org/education.</p> 
      <p><b>The Volunteer Program</b></p> 
      <p>In 2007, nearly 3,800 volunteers hailed from all 50 US states and 80 countries. Volunteers are drawn from the public as well as key constituencies such as educators, corporations, artists, communities local to project sites, and partner organizations. Volunteer teams are intergenerational: 13 percent of 2007 volunteers were under 20 (minimum age is 16 with a parent on adult teams, 16 on Teen teams, and 10 for Family teams); 18 percent were 20-29; 16 percent were 30-39; 14 percent were 40-49; 16 percent were 50-59; and 22 percent were 60+ years old. Of all volunteers, 94 percent have attended or graduated from college and 41 percent have a post-graduate degree. They include office professionals and managers (18 percent), students (18 percent), educators (25 percent), zoo, aquarium, public service, and heath care professionals (12 percent), scientists, engineers, computer workers, and creative professionals (11 percent) and retirees (14 percent). One third of Earthwatch volunteers each year are returning volunteers, and several have participated on more than 50 projects. Earthwatch team members share the costs of research expeditions and cover food and lodging expenses with a pro-rated, US tax-deductible contribution. In 2007, expedition costs range from $199 to more than $4,000, averaging $2,500 for 1-20 day team duration. No prior skills are required, except scuba certification for diving projects.</p> 
      <p><b>Corporate Partnerships</b></p> 
      <p>Earthwatch is proud to collaborate with nearly 40 corporate partners around the world, in industry sectors ranging from banking and financial services to consumer products, agriculture, and extractives. We ranked 11th out of 550 organizations featured in the “Business Guide to Partnering with NGOs and the United Nations,” which was published in 2007 by The Financial Times, the United Nations Global Compact and Dalberg Global Development Advisors. Earthwatch believes there has never been a more important time to engage the business community. Companies are increasingly aware that both their shareholders and the planet will suffer if they do not incorporate sustainable practices into their business strategies. By working collaboratively with the business sector we can mobilize the resources necessary to help conserve the environment while at the same time build corporate awareness, understanding, and participation in environmental and social sustainability efforts. Earthwatch seeks out companies that take their environmental responsibilities and performance seriously and are open to working constructively with us to benefit the environment and help us achieve our mission.

      <p><b>Public Outreach</b></p> 
      <p>The Earthwatch web site at www.earthwatch.org encompasses more than 1,500 pages of in-depth project descriptions, expedition briefings, photos, videos, news releases, and educational resources.</p> 
      <p>Earthwatch experiences have profound impacts on volunteers' lives, often changing how return volunteers think and act in their communities. The organization is aided by a network of more than 150 field representatives in 41 US states and Canada. These veteran Earthwatch volunteers organize events and educational outreach, working toward Earthwatch's goal of building an engaged citizenry. Field Reps are listed at www.earthwatch.org/expedition/volunteering/fireps.</p> 
      <p><b>Membership</b></p> 
      <p>Earthwatch's 85,000 US members and alumni hail from all 50 states. Membership benefits include the Earthwatch Expedition Guide detailing our complete portfolio of research expeditions, our member publication The Earthwatch Journal, expedition discounts, invitations to events, an e-newsletter, and the satisfaction in knowing that your annual contribution directly supports critical research, education and outreach efforts in the most threatened ecosystems and communities around the world.</p> 
      <p><b>Minimizing our impact on the environment</b></p> 
      <p>Earthwatch projects are located around the world, which necessarily involves international travel for volunteers, staff, and fellows. We recognize the impacts of air travel on the environment, and are concerned about these contributions to climate change. Earthwatch uses carbon offsets to compensate for the emissions we produce with an equivalent carbon saving. This involves purchasing carbon credits or emission reduction credits, which have been generated by projects that have reduced carbon emissions. These projects involve renewable energy, energy efficiency, and forest restoration projects. We currently work with Climate Care and the Carbon Fund to purchase carbon offsets for the air travel and local travel of our staff members, volunteers and most fellows, and are designing programs that minimize the amount of travel we require.</p>
