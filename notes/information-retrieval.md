# Search Engines

## Search and Information Retrieval

 - Search on the Web is a daily activity for many people throughout the world
 - According to Jon Tran, "We have reached the end of the information research with elastic search."
 - "The delivery mechanism is not the issue. This is as fast as it gets"
 - Information predicition is the third order of knowledge, and the next hot topic in R&D.

## Information Retrieval

 - Organization is key.
 - Has been an issue since the 50's
 - "Information retrieval is a field concerned with the structure, analysis, organization, storage, searching, and retrieval of information." (Salton, 1968)

## What is a Document?

 - Examples:
  - web pages, email, books, text messages, Word, Powerpoint, PDF, etc.
 - Common properties
  - Significant text content
  - Some structure (e.g., title, author, date for papers)

## Documents vs. Database Records

 - Database records are typically made up of well-defines fields
 - Easy to compare fields
 - Text is more difficult

## Comparing Text

 - Comparing the query text to the document text and determining what is a good match is the **core** issue of information retrieval.

## Dimensions of IR

 What is a Dimension?
 - A way to classify things (sight, touch, etc)

 - Content
  - Text
  - Images
  - Video
  - Scanned Documents
  - Audio
  - Music

 - Applications
  - Web search
  - Vertical search
  - Enterprise search
  - Desktop search
  - Forum search
  - P2P search
  - Literature search

 - Tasks
  - Ad hoc search - find relevant documents for an arbitrary text query
  - Classification - Identify relevant labels for documents
  - Question Answering - Give specific answer to a question
  - Filtering - Identify relevant user profiles for a new document 

Jon Tran - "We cannot possibly produce enough content (excluding video) to fill up our storage capacity"

## Big Issues in IR

 - Relevance
 - Evaluation
 - Users and Information Needs

## IR and Search Engines

 - Indexes are data structures designed to improve search efficiency (not a huge issue, according to jon)
